# sd-vehcontrol

sd‑vehcontrol is a sleek, fully customizable vehicle control menu that gives players one‑click access to change seats and manipulate engine, doors, windows, lights, and more. Its built‑in settings panel lets each user adjust UI color, scale, and on‑screen position—which is persisted via KVP so their layout “sticks” across sessions.
